  abstract = {Two experiments replicated the `inverse base-rate effect' reported in categorization studies by Medin \& Edelson. In Experiment I subjects were presented with the case histories of hypothetical medical patients and had to diagnose which illness they thought each patient was suffering from on the basis of the symptoms they had. On some trials (AB-{$\rightarrow$}1), patients had two symptoms, A and B, and the correct diagnosis was disease 1. On other trials (AC-{$\rightarrow$}2)patients had symptoms A and C and the correct diagnosis was disease 2. Feedback was provided on each trial about the correct diagnosis. Symptom A was common to both diseases, but subjects saw more AB-{$\rightarrow$}1 than AC-{$\rightarrow$}2 trials. On subsequent test trials subjects were more likely to choose disease 1 than disease 2 as their diagnosis for patients who had just symptom A, in accordance with the base-rates of the two diseases. However, on test trials where patients had both symptoms B and C, which had never previously occurred together, subjects were more likely to choose disease 2, contrary not only to the underlying base-rates, but also to the predictions of a well-established connectionist model of categorization. A variety of alternative connectionist models are considered. In Experiment 2 it was found that a necessary condition for the inverse base-rate effect is that symptom A is more strongly associated with disease 1 than disease 2, which is consistent with an associative learning account which appeals to the notion of competition between symptoms. A new connectionist learning model, using a learning algorithm based on Wagner's theory of associative learning, is shown to be able to reproduce the main results.},

This research sought to account for both phenomena with J. K. Kruschke's (1996, 2001, 2003) attention theory of category learning. According to the model, the features of majority groups are learned earlier than the features of minority groups. In turn, the features that become associated with a minority are those that most distinguish it from the majority. This second process is driven by an attention-shifting mechanism that directs attention toward group\textendash{}attribute pairings that facilitate differentiation of the two groups and may lead to the formation of stronger minority stereotypes. Five experiments supported this model as a common account for category accentuation and distinctiveness-based illusory correlation. Implications for the natures of stereotype formation, illusory correlation, and impression formation are discussed.},

  abstract = {The inverse base-rate effect is a bias in contingency learning in which participants tend to predict a rare outcome for a conflicting set of perfectly predictive cues. Although the effect is often explained by attention biases during learning, inferential strategies at test may also contribute substantially to the effect. In three experiments, we manipulated the frequencies of outcomes and trial types to determine the critical conditions for the effect, thereby providing novel tests of the reasoning processes that could contribute to it. The rare bias was substantially reduced when the outcomes were experienced at equal rates in the presence of predictive-cue frequency differences (Exp. 2), and when the predictive cues were experienced at equal rates in the presence of outcome frequency differences (Exp. 3). We also found a consistent commonoutcome bias for novel cue compounds. The results indicate the importance of both cue and outcome frequencies to the inverse base-rate effect, and reveal a combination of necessary conditions that are not well captured by appealing to inferential strategies at test. Although both attention-based and inferential theories explain some aspects of these data, no existing theory fully accounts for these effects of relative novelty.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the use of base-rate information that is derived from experience in classifying examples of a category. The basic task involved simulated medical decision making in which participants learned to diagnose hypothetical diseases on the basis of symptom information. Alternative diseases differed in their relative frequency or base rates of occurrence. In five experiments initial learning was followed by a series of transfer tests designed to index the use of base-rate information. On these tests, patterns of symptoms were presented that suggested more than one disease and were therefore ambiguous. The results reveal a consistent but complex pattern. Depending on the category structure and the nature of the ambiguous tests, participants use base-rate information appropriately, ignore base-rate information, or use base-rate information inappropriately (predict that the rare disease is more likely to be present). To our knowledge, no current categorization model predicts this pattern of results. To account for these results, a new model is described incorporating the ideas of property or symptom competition and context-sensitive retrieval.

abstract = {Abstract The inverse base rate effect (IBRE) is a nonrational behavioral phenomenon in predictive learning. Canonically, participants learn that the AB stimulus compound leads to one outcome and that AC leads to another outcome, with AB being presented three times as often as AC. When subsequently presented with BC, the outcome associated with AC is preferentially selected, in opposition to the underlying base rates of the outcomes. The current leading explanation is based on error-driven learning. A key component of this account is prediction error, a concept previously linked to a number of brain areas including the anterior cingulate, the striatum, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The present work is the first fMRI study to directly examine the IBRE. Activations were noted in brain areas linked to prediction error, including the caudate body, the anterior cingulate, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Analyzing the difference in activations for singular key stimuli (B and C), as well as frequency matched controls, supports the predictions made by the error-driven learning account.}
